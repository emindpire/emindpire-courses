Python Developers made a specific ways to make the string more flexible by adding some function on it.

So, if you want to write a string with two lines or more. We can easily use the '\n' to make it.
Let me give an example:
i want to write two phrases or sentences, with making new lines between each sentence:
	
	sentence = 'Hello World! \n My name is Rami.'
	print(sentence) 
	# The print function can show the variable or whatever the data-type you prented on your console or terminal.

	The result on the console is: 
		Hello World!
		 My name is Rami.

So as you saw, the '\n' made a new line between those phrases which can help us when we write a pragraph or a story or a big text in general.
Note: The reason why there's a small space before the second sentence (in console) is because we've add a space before 'My' in the variable. So to avoid this problem, we should write the '\n' and the second sentence like that :  \nMy name is Rami.
