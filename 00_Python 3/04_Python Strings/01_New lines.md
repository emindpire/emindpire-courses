Python Developers made a specific way to make the string more flexible by adding some functions on it.

So, if you wanna write a string with two lines or more. You can easily use the '\n' to make it.
Lemme give you an example:
I wannna write two sentences with making a line between each one of them:
	
	sentence = 'Hello World! \n My name is Rami.'
	print(sentence) 
	# The print function can show the variable or whatever the data-type you prented on your console or terminal.

	The result on the console is: 
		Hello World!
		 My name is Rami.

So as you've seen, the '\n' made a new line between those phrases which can help us to write some bigger texts in general.
Note: The reason why there's a small space before the second sentence (in console) is because we've added a space before 'My' in the variable. So to avoid this issue, we have to write the '\n' like that :  \nMy name is Rami.
