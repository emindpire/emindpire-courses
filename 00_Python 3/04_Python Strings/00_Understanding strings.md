String in python is a collection of characters which written inside single or double quotes.
Let's Take an example:
	name = 'Rami'

- As you can see, we wrote a string, inside a variable (you're gonna know more about it in the next section). And the string is inside single quotes.
- The Characters (its been mentioned in the definition) here are the letters R A M I.

Now let's take another example:
	random = "{{]]#~218"

- Here, we put the string inside double quotes, and we wrote throw it numbers & symboles.

Note: You cannot write a string without storing it inside a variable or any other data-type.
Example:
	'DJ'
	# ... code
	
^ Here you're going to Syntax Error

What we Concluse:
	- Strings can be written only in varibles or other data-types.
	- Strings can be empty or contains (numbers, letters, symboles, etc)
	- Strings can be written inside single, double and triple quotes.
