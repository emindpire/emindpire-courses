As we saw before. Strings has a specific unicode to give them more flexibility.
And now we're going to see some functions that can help us to edit our strings.

1 - Upper function:
	This function can switch the string characters from the lower-case to the upper-case (only if they were in the lower-case). Example:
		company = 'emindPire'
		print(company.upper())

	Result:
	EMINDPIRE

2 - Lower function:
	Simpily, its the opposite the the upper function,
	Example:
		company = 'EMINDpIRE'
		print(company.lower())

	Result:
	emindpire

3 - Len function:
	This function gives you the length of your string (number of charcters).
	Example:
		company = 'Emindpire'
		print(len(company))

	Result:
	9

4 - Capitalize function:
	This function will switch the first character of the string from the lower-case to the upper-case (Only if it were a letter).
	Example:
		company = 'emindpire'
		print(company.capitalize()) 

	Result:
	Emindpire


5 - Count function:
	This function will count the number of the repetation of a specific character.
	Example:
		company = 'emindpire'
		print(company.count('e'))

	Result:
	2
